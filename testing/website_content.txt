A Comparison of The Effects of Political and Economic Structure on Wealth Across Countries

Will Campbell
Abstract
This paper analyzes the effects of political and economic freedom on GDP per capita using a large sample of countries. Both democracy and economic reform programs have been advocated as an escape from poverty in poor countries and a road to better growth for others. The extent to which each ideology actually contributes to wealth across nations is of interest to determine what institutions are most important: economic or political. Using a sample of 156 countries, economic and political institutions are compared across an aggregate group, a group of above-median-income countries, and below-median. Results show that economic structures are more important for income in the lower-income and aggregate sample, while political structures are more important in the higher-income sample. These differences may be explained in part by the greater political importance of investment in high-income countries than in the low ones. Wealthy countries tend to be more democratic and wish to economically associate with similar countries for political reasons. On the other hand, poor countries are less politically important, and investment can have a greater effect on the smaller economy, making economic structures more relevant.

Introduction
This paper attempts to measure the degree to which political and economic structures contribute to levels of economic well-being. Democracy is often advocated for on the basis that it increases both economic performance at the aggregate level through strong institutions as well as on an individual level by allowing for freedom of choice and opportunity. It is of interest to empirically compare this theory with others that are politically agnostic but argue in support of free markets based on the idea that over-regulation and anti-competitive policies prevent efficient outcomes from being reached. To test both ideas, measurements of political and economic freedom are used to estimate economic welfare and performance as measured by GDP per capita for a large sample of countries. 

A common and logical hypothesis for democracy contributing to economic growth is that stable political environments are conducive to long term economic development. In a sample of about 100 countries Rodrik (1999) finds that democracies economically outperform authoritarian regimes by handling shocks better, having higher wages, and more predictable and steady output trends. Together these outcomes are suggested to result from political and civil liberties which then create a higher quality of living. Using data from 1960 to 1990, Barro (1996) analyzes economic growth against measures of democracy for a large group of countries and finds that improvements in democracy lead to higher economic growth for low-income countries. However, it is also found that improvements in democracy are associated with insignificant to negative economic effects for higher income countries. Barro also finds that improvements in economic growth tend to lead to more democracy alongside higher levels of human capital which is consistent with a democratic lock in mechanism. That is, as incomes grow, citizens naturally gain more power relative to a government and incrementally achieve democratic steps such as regular elections, and each subsequent step locks in the previous one. One limitation of studies using data before 1990 though is the exclusion of ‘Third Wave of Democracy’ which accelerated after the collapse of the Soviet Union as well as with globalization into the 2000’s. By analyzing political regime changes over time, Acemoglu et. al (2019) find that permanent transitions to democracy lead to significant long-term growth in GDP per capita. Another issue with measuring democracy in such studies is the subjective nature of what makes a country more democratic and difficulty in measuring choses variables, so results rely heavily on many assumptions. 

Economic liberalization, like democracy, has increasingly been advocated for after the 1980’s as a means to greater economic growth especially for underdeveloped countries. Implementation of reforms have often been forced onto countries when receiving international support via development loans and aid. Success of these reforms has varied largely; Chile for example liberalized its economy to great success while under an authoritarian regime, while many countries such as those in Africa have failed to even reform inefficient institutions to promote growth in the first place. Jalilian et. al (2006) finds a strong link between the quality of regulatory institutions and economic performance; rather than a complete absence of regulation, efficient and well governed regulatory bodies are found to improve growth. This helps to explain differences in the economic performance of more authoritarian regimes where successful ones have focused on limiting corruption and inefficiencies, at least in regulatory institutions. It is also suggested by Giavazzi & Tabellini (2005) that liberalization of the economy leads to better outcomes when it precedes democratizations, meaning economic structure may outweigh the political structure in importance. This hypothesis is tested in this paper using an aggregate sample of countries, as well as subgroups of high and low-income countries. Results show economic structure is more important for levels of GDP per capita in low-income countries, while political structure is more important in high-income countries.

Data
Data is collected from The World Bank for the following variables across 156 countries (countries with missing data were dropped from the sample): GDP per capita measured in purchasing power parity (simply referred to as GDP from now), Voice and Accountability Index (VA), and Ease of Doing Business Index (DBI). GDP is measured as the average from 2015 to 2019, DBI is from 2019 only (the only year available via World Bank), and VA is averaged from 2010 to 2019. VA is found to be fairly stable over this time period, and averaging allows for inclusion of a greater number of countries where data may be missing for certain years. Data is segmented into three groups with the first being all countries, the second being countries with GDP greater than the median, and the third containing GDP less than or equal to median. For the two subsets, both the DBI and VA variables were reindexed so that it shows the countries rank between 1 and 76, where 1 represents the country with the highest ease of doing business and 76 is the worst ease of doing business score. Similarly, a value of 1 for VA represents the country with the highest voice and accountability score in the sample and 76 the lowest, with a lower value (e.g. 1) implying more political freedom. 

Methodology
In order to estimate the relationship between GDP, VA and DBI, an Ordinary-Least-Squares model is estimated for each sample explained above using GDP as the dependent variable and VA and DBI as independent variables. All variables are transformed to natural logs resulting in the following model:
logGDPi= 0+1log(VAi)+2log(DBIi) + i
Each coefficient therefore shows the percent change in GDP resulting from a 1 percent increase in the independent variable. Each model is found to be significant below the 0.01 level based on a joint Wald Test.

Results
Results for the three different groups of countries are presented in Table I below:

 Beginning with the aggregate sample, both VA and DBI are statistically significant below the 0.01 level, and both negatively relate with GDP. That is, countries with lower ranks (in other words, better) on both the VA and DBI indices have higher levels of wealth, which is expected based on previous literature. Additionally, the coefficients are both greater in size compared to those in the segmented samples discussed next, and DBI is found to have more influence than VA on GDP. This implies that the economic environment, as measured by conduciveness to business, is more important for economic well-being than the political environment is across countries. However, one problem with the aggregate sample is a moderate level of multicollinearity between VA and DBI (~0.48) which means the variables could be accounting for overlapping variation in GDP. When divided into two samples containing countries with GDP greater than median, and less than median, the correlation of the independent variables falls to 0.28 in the above-median group and 0.37 in the below-median group. This division also allows for better inference into the relationship of these variables in higher and lower income countries.

As in the aggregate model, the sign of the coefficients for both VA and DBI in high-income countries is negative, but VA is found to contribute more than DBI in these countries which is opposite of the aggregate sample. The absolute size of each coefficient is smaller, which may be evidence of diminishing returns of the contributions of democracy and economic freedom to a country’s wealth as it increases. For high-income countries, it makes sense for democracy to increase in importance relative to the ease of doing business. That is because investment naturally has a smaller effect on an economy as it grows, and political ramifications increase at the same time. For wealthier countries, which tend to be more democratic, there are strategic considerations driving them to politically and economically align with other countries sharing similar characteristics, leading to further wealth creation amongst democracies. On the other hand, investing in smaller economies can have a large economic influence from smaller amounts, and political considerations will be usually less important. 
Results for the lower income countries show the signs for VA and DBI are still negative as with the other groups, but a lower DBI rank has more than two times the effect on GDP than VA rank does, which is the largest difference in magnitudes of coefficients of the three samples. This implies that for lower-income countries, the business environment is much more important than the political environment. This can likely be explained in part by the converse of the argument above for high-income countries, which would mean the political environment is less important for smaller countries and because of the smaller economy size, it is much more sensitive to investment.

The results also provide evidence for Jalilian’s (2007) argument that quality of regulatory institutions is a key determinant of economic growth. Lower income countries should have larger variation in the quality of their regulations (which is evident in the standard errors of DBI above) as some try to develop while others deal with corruption, but generally have more negative regulations which discourage foreign and private investment much more than a negative political system would. Other factors also seem to play a larger role in determining wealth in lower-income countries. VA and DBI are only found to account for 19% of the variation in GDP in these countries versus 34% in the high-income sample which implies variables other than those of political and economic freedom are more relevant in explaining GDP variation in lower-income countries. 

Figure I shows the relationship between GDP and VA and GDP and DBI in high and low income countries. The differences in variation of GDP explained by the independent variables for the two samples is evident in the graph. For high income countries, a clear negative relationship between GDP and VA and GDP and DBI can be seen, while these relationships only appear to be weakly negative at best in the lower income group. In higher-income countries, there are more outliers with higher GDP and VA rankings than there are with higher GDP and DBI rankings. This may be evidence for findings by Barro (1996) that democracy is less important for development in higher income countries, however without accounting for trends it is not possible to know whether the high income or VA ranking came first and caused or affected the other.
Figure I

Conclusion
Results from the three models discussed above show that levels of political and economic freedom contribute differently to GDP per capita across countries depending on the country’s wealth. At the aggregate level and for lower-income countries economic freedom as measured by the ease of doing business index is more important than political freedom as measured by the voice and accountability index. For high-income countries this relationship is reversed. These results are consistent with previous literature which suggests better rankings of each variable should align with greater wealth. By using updated data and more refined measurements of political and economic liberties than have previously been available, and comparing these data across different groups of countries, this paper also contributes to understanding whether political or economic structures are more important for economic performance.

United States Monetary Policy Transmission
to Foreign Economies: VAR Analysis

Billy Campbell
Abstract

This paper examines the effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks on output levels and trade
balances of several foreign economies from 1996 to 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank uses the
FFR to influence the domestic economy to fulfill its mandate of maximum employment and
stable prices in the U.S. but in an integrated economy these actions spillover to foreign
economies as well. We investigate the extent of these spillovers in the G7 countries and Mexico
using Vector Autoregressions to measure the effect of FFR shocks on foreign output and trade
balances compared to the U.S. Impulse response functions show that most countries experience
larger output spillovers than the U.S. while trade balance and currency movements are not
significant in size, and do not move as expected by the Mundell Fleming model in multiple
countries. Large and negative output spillovers imply that the U.S. may benefit at the expense of
other countries when using contractionary policy, as some of the output trade-off to reduce
inflation for example, is transferred to foreign economies.

1. Introduction
This paper studies the effects of United States monetary policy shocks on foreign economies’
trade balance and output. While the Federal Reserve Bank uses the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) to
conduct monetary policy to influence the U.S. economy, the global integration of the U.S.
economy and wide use of the U.S. dollar in international financial transactions creates an
environment where U.S. policy decisions may have positive or negative unintended
consequences for the global economy. Under the Mundell Fleming model, a raise in the FFR
would lead to increased capital flows to the U.S. which causes a depreciation of the foreign
currency and subsequently an increase in the foreign country’s exports. This increase in exports,
allowed by a flexible exchange rate, mitigates some output decline which is associated with a
higher world interest rate. This paper attempts to measure the degree to which such a monetary
shock in the U.S. affects several foreign countries relative to the U.S. as well as the length of
duration at which these effects occur in foreign countries compared to the U.S. The first question
is of interest to understand whether intended effects of domestic monetary policy such as
reducing inflation by increasing the FFR to slow growth can have a larger effect in foreign
economies. The second question is of interest to determine whether the domestic economy is
more resilient to changes in the FFR than foreign countries. If this is the case, depending on the
size of the effects found from the first question, the U.S. may have to inflict disproportionate
harm on the global economy relative to itself in order to achieve its policy goals.

Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis is used in this paper to examine the relationship between
net trade in value of goods, real gross domestic output, FFR, and exchange rates for the G7
nations (United States, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Canada and Japan) and

3
Mexico. The G7 countries are chosen to study due to their high level of global financial
integration and cooperation which should allow the effects of U.S. monetary shocks, if there are
any, to be more easily traceable compared to less developed countries. Mexico is included for
similar reasons that result from the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as its shared
border with the U.S. allowing for easier trade.

VAR’s are employed to examine FFR shocks in each country, and the shock of FFR on the U.S.
economy is also imposed to give a baseline for comparison. Results from impulse response
functions show that contractionary monetary policy generally reduces foreign and domestic
output for multiple quarters. The decrease in output is larger in most foreign economies than it is
in the U.S. and tends to have a similar duration of persistence of four to six quarters until about
75 percent of the shock has dissipated. Impulse response functions for trade balances are less
conclusive; some countries show increases in net trade of goods, while others show a decrease,
but the changes are generally small as a percent of GDP.

Discussion of related literature is conducted in section 2. Data sources and specific variable
details and transformations are explained in section 3. Details of the VAR models are provided
alongside reasoning for feature selection in section 4. Then results of impulse response functions
and forecast error variance decompositions are presented and discussed in section 5. Finally, key
findings and their implications are reported in section 6.

2. Literature Review
Existing literature largely focuses on the accuracy of the transmission mechanism used in the
Mundell-Fleming (MF) model of international finance which uses IS-LM-BP analysis to predict
capital flows, exchange rate responses, interest rate changes and changes in trade balance in an
open economy with flexible exchange rates in response to exogenous shocks. In multi-country
studies (e.g. Georgiadis 2015, Iacoviello 2019) foreign GDP is found to drop by as much or more
than it does in the U.S. in response to contractionary monetary policy while the transmission
mechanism, such as through trade balance or interest rates, varies based on country
characteristics, and a generalized transmission mechanism is not evident.

This paper focuses on the results and methodologies employed in two published papers. First,
Kim (2001) attempts to identify the transmission mechanism of U.S. monetary policy shocks to
non-U.S. G6 countries using VAR analysis. In response to expansionary U.S. monetary shocks,
foreign trade balances worsened initially, then improved after about a year with peak
improvements between 0.04-0.06%. Because of the magnitude of these changes, it is suggested
trade balance does not play as large of a role as suggested by the MF model. Additionally, Kim
finds U.S. real GDP increases by 0.2-0.4% at the peak, while foreign countries’ output increase
by 0.05-0.2% at the peak. Finally, Kim tests how closely non-U.S. G7 monetary policy follows
that of the U.S. and finds the relationship between interest rates is not significant except in
Canada.

Second, Georgiadis (2015) examines spillovers of U.S. monetary policy to a large group of
countries and finds these spillovers are often larger than those experienced in the U.S. Georgiadis

5
uses VAR analysis to examine what country characteristics are relevant in determining the size of
spillovers. More advanced economies are found to have larger spillovers to output,
Southeast-Asian economies experienced weaker effects, and countries with higher quality
institutions had larger spillovers. Finally, Georgiadis suggests global welfare may be improved if
U.S. policymakers considered spillovers or improved coordination of international monetary
policy.

3. Data
All data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website. For each country
quarterly data is collected for real GDP, nominal trade balance (NTB), GDP deflator, and
exchange rate of foreign currency to US Dollars. Real GDP and NTB are in terms of each
country’s domestic currency. The GDP deflator is also specific to each country. For European
Monetary Union (EMU) member countries (France, Italy, Germany) data is collected beginning
in the first quarter of 1999, when the Euro was introduced, until the first quarter of 2023. For
non-EMU countries, data is collected beginning in the first quarter of 1996 until the first quarter
of 2023.

Variable transformations follow a similar convention that was used by Kim (2001) where real
trade balance is divided by the mean of real GDP over the time period, FFR is calculated as
levels, and all other variables are calculated as log change. For FFR this convention was not
followed in our models as the variable was not found to be stationary after one difference, so it is
also calculated as log change. To calculate the equivalent variable for trade balance of each
country, NTB is divided by the GDP deflator to obtain real net trade which is then divided by the

6
mean of real GDP. This variable will be referred to as TB or trade balance and the scale will
show changes in trade as a percentage of mean GDP.

Each variable for each country was tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dicky-Fuller test
using the null hypothesis of the series having a unit root, and the alternative hypothesis of the
series being stationary. At the five percent significance level, the null hypothesis of
non-stationarity was rejected for each variable in each country when testing for a unit root with
no drift or trend, a unit root with drift, and a unit root with trend and drift.

4. Methodology
For each of the eight countries in our sample, we estimated a Vector Autoregression (VAR)
model containing the following variables: GDP, exchange rate (E), trade balance (TB) and FFR.
In order to identify structural shocks, we use the following ordering: GDP, E, TB, FFR. This
ordering and implied Cholesky Decomposition leads to a recursive VAR model given by:

where optimal lags were selected to be 1 for each model using Bayesian Inference Criterion.
GDP is placed first since it is generally a large driver of economic activity, then E is second since
each currency is flexible which causes changes in the trade balance. TB is placed third due to its

7
sensitivity to changes in exchange rates and output. FFR is placed last since monetary policy is a
reactionary procedure to changes in economic variables. A recursive VAR is also calculated for
the United States to use as a baseline for comparison to shocks in foreign countries. The VAR
excludes exchange rate information and is ordered [GDP, TB, FFR] for similar reasons as above.

5. Results
5.1 Impulse responses of Trade Balance
Figure One shows the impulse response functions to trade balance from a 1 standard deviation
positive shock to FFR. 95% confidence bands are shown to measure precision and the scale
shows the change in trade balance as a percentage of mean GDP. The U.S. shows an increase in
TB for multiple quarters, while the results in foreign countries are mixed. The largest non-U.S.
increase occurs in the U.K. at 0.12% and the largest decreases occur in France and Japan around
-0.03%. For most countries the changes in trade balance are not persistent at the 0.95 level of
significance and are not large as a percent of GDP.

According to the MF model, an increase in interest rates should attract capital inflows, which
cause the domestic currency to appreciate, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive
for foreign countries, which then reduces the trade balance. The results for the U.S. where TB
increases, and for several countries where TB decreases are not consistent with the MF model.
One implication of the MF model is that countries with a flexible exchange rate, such as those
studied here, should see increased demand for their goods as the currency depreciates in response
to an external shock (such as increased foreign interest rates) which then helps to insulate output
from spillovers. Our results show that in response to a temporary shock, this adjustment

8
mechanism does not have a significant effect and exchange rates actually appreciate in some
foreign countries, which means spillovers from U.S. monetary policy may be more negative than
expected.

The results for foreign trade balances experiencing small spillovers align with previous literature
(e.g. Kim 2001) but the finding of an increase in U.S. trade balance is different. One possible
explanation is similar to a situation in which the Marshall Lerner Condition (MLC) does not
hold. The MLC suggests that if the demand for exports and imports is not inelastic (sum of
export and import demand elasticities is greater than 1), an appreciation of the currency will
decrease the trade balance. However, if the MLC does not hold (and therefore export and import
demand is inelastic) then an appreciation of the currency can increase the trade balance until the
substitutes are found and elasticities adjust over time. Because we only study a temporary shock,
it is possible that elasticities for traded goods are low and do not adjust which causes the trade
balance to move contrary to expectations.

5.2 Impulse responses of GDP
Figure two shows the impulse response functions of GDP for each country to a 1 standard
deviation positive shock to FFR. The vertical axis represents GDP in terms of percent change
and the horizontal axis shows the time in quarters such that the response over ten quarters is
shown. The results vary in size and level of significance, but each country shows a negative
response to the contractionary U.S. monetary shock.

9
The decrease is largest in the quarter following the shock for each country, then is lower by
80-90% after 4-6 periods. The initial GDP decrease in the U.S. is about 0.15% while in other
countries it decreases by 0.06-0.5% and is larger than that of the U.S. in six of the seven foreign
countries (all but Japan.) The decrease is statistically significant for the longest duration in the
U.S. and Canada. Considering the cumulative effects shown in Table I below, and persistence at
a lower level of significance, it is evident that the contractionary shock from the U.S. can hurt the
foreign economies’ GDP much more than its own. The differences in magnitudes of output
decreases are interestingly reversed from those found by Kim (2001) where output increases in
foreign countries from expansionary monetary shocks were only about one-fourth of the increase
in the U.S, but align with Georgiadis (2015) who found output decreases were larger than in the
U.S. for advanced economies.

6. Conclusion
Results from VAR models of foreign countries show that effects of monetary shocks to trade
balances are generally small and not entirely consistent with existing theories such as the MF
model. One explanation may be that the shock imposed in our models is temporary, and as a
result does not propagate the same way a long term shift would exchange rate adjustment and

10
import substitution. One reason explored above is that the Marshall Lerner condition may not
hold initially, and therefore our results are only capturing the initial part of the J-curve where
trade balance moves in the direction opposite to what is expected. Additionally, interpretation of
the results may be limited by focusing on aggregate rather than bilateral trade balance between
the U.S. and foreign countries. Despite the FFR shock appearing to have little effect on output
via the trade balance, we find output effects are significant. These results suggest foreign interest
rates may be the main channel of propagation which is consistent with uncovered interest parity.

Negative spillovers from U.S. monetary policy to foreign economies’ output are large and have
several implications. First, U.S. contractionary monetary policy aimed at reducing domestic
output growth may inflict more harm on foreign economies. This is significant because it means
in order to achieve their goals of stable prices during periods of high inflation, U.S. policymakers
must also harm foreign economies due to the unintended spillovers. Georgiadis (2015) suggests
that U.S. policymakers should ‘internalize’ these effects when making their decisions to
potentially cause less harm to global welfare. These suggestions naturally lead to the second
implication which is that global monetary policy may be a zero-sum game. That is, a monetary
hegemon such as the U.S. benefits at the expense of others by experiencing smaller output
changes from its own policies. This situation would then discourage monetary coordination if
redistributing monetary power could reduce foreign spillovers, thereby increasing domestic
effects for the large country. For example, if domestic inflation is driven in part by global
aggregate demand in an open economy and output in the large country (e.g. the U.S.) decreases
by less than in foreign countries as a result of increased interest rates (to lower inflation), then
the large economy offshores some of the output trade-off of its goals to foreign economies, but at

11
a greater cost than it experiences itself. Future research can further examine the hypotheses
above to see whether absorption of output spillovers in foreign economies helps the U.S. better
achieve its policy goals.

Automatically plotting and forecasting any BLS series
William Campbell
2024-07-26
This document showcases a pipeline to automatically forecast and plot any data series available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The pipeline is built on top of BLS API’s, as well as the forecast and ggplot2 packages in R. Using a BLS API key is highly recommended to avoid query limitations.

arima_plots function
The arima_plots function allows for generation of an auto-fitted ARIMA model which is plotted along with historical data for any BLS series. Various arguments are accepted to customize the returned plot. Source code for the first version is available in the Appendix.

In future versions support for FRED data, smoothing models, and other chart types will be added. Additionally, support for simple and advanced visualization without forecasting is under development.

(R CODE)#Example usage
arima_plots(series_names = c('LNS14000000','CUUR0000SA0','JTS000000000000000JOL','WPUFD49207'),
            titles =c('Unemployment Rate (Seasonally Adjusted)','CPI for All Urban Consumers',
                      'JOLTS (Seasonally Adjusted)','PPI Finished Goods'),
            include = 40,
            mom_growth_rate = c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE),
            yoy_growth_rate = c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE),
            ylabel = c('Percent','Percent Change MoM','Number in Thousands','Percent Change MoM'))


The arima_plots() function also allows year over year and monthly growth rates to be plotted as shown below:

(R CODE)#Plotting CPI three different ways
arima_plots(series_names = c('CUUR0000SA0','CUUR0000SA0','CUUR0000SA0'),
            titles = c('CPI Index 1982-84 = 100','CPI Month over Month',
                       'CPI Year over Year'), ylabel = c('Index Value', 'Growth Rate', 'Growth Rate'),
            include = 40,
            mom_growth_rate = c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE),
            yoy_growth_rate = c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE),
            n_col = 1,
            summary = TRUE)

Summary Statistics for Each Series
Series	CurrentValue	OneYearAvg	OneYearHigh	OneYearLow	Forecast1	Forecast2	Forecast3
CPI Index 1982-84 = 100	314.18	309.57	314.18	305.69	313.94	314.34	314.6
CPI Month over Month	0.03	0.24	0.64	-0.2	-0.09	0.11	0.07
CPI Year over Year	2.97	3.3	3.7	2.97	2.63	2.14	1.86
The arima_plots function makes creating economic outlook reports simple. The following example shows how one can generate such reports with only three lines of code.

A Kaggle Project
This is a machine learning project I did on Kaggle to predict sale prices of houses. I cleaned, transformed, and encoded the 60+ features in the data, then used an XGBoost model to predict the sale price. I got a score in the top 10% of competition entries. Outside of coding practice, I don't find Kaggle very appealing since it encourages fitting to the test set, especially when people submit 200-300 entries in a competition.

Can you beat ARIMA at forecasting time series?
In my time series forecasting class I didn't exactly believe in the power of simple ARIMA models. I always thought I could simply draw a line and get about the same accuracy. Well it turns out ARIMA is often better than me, but more importantly in my opinion unbiased. I made a simple game using real stock price data to try to draw a line that would beat an autofitted ARIMA model at forecasting 10 periods into the future.ARIMA forecasting game gif

My Bookshelf & Books I like
Book image
I have a very strong preference for books that are old, challenging to read, esoteric, and which do not make sense the first (or even third) time I read them. What I enjoy most about reading is trying to understand what is happening in the author's head rather than what their words are saying. It is especially hard to convey abstract ideas in writing so I believe that even with the best authors there is always deeper meaning or truth than what is evident. Here are some of my favorites:

Zen in the Art of Archery, Eugen Herrigel

Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu

The Unfettered Mind, Takuan Soho

Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche

The New Market Wizards, Jack Schwager

Honorable Mention: Extreme Ownership, Jocko Willink A great book on leadership
